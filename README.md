#Kodi Assist#

The ultimate Kodi Windows Phone remote.

Based on akshay2000/XBMCRemoteRT (lates build from August 2015), which I believe is the best Kodi remote for Windows Phone, but with some added features:

- removed nagging donate reminder which appears frequently
- in server list, added options for suspend, reboot and shutdown Kodi server in context menu (long press on item in the list)
- in remote, added similar set of options in advanced menu
- changed 2 icons to be easy to recognize: "OSD" to display OSD when playing media, and "i" to display media info
