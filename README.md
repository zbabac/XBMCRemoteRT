#Kodi Assist#

The ultimate Kodi Windows Phone remote.

Based on akshay2000/XBMCRemoteRT (latest build from August 2015), which I believe is the best Kodi remote for Windows Phone, but I added some features:

- removed nagging donate reminder which appears frequently
- in server list, added options for suspend, reboot and shutdown Kodi server in context menu (long press on item in the list)
- in remote, added similar set of options in advanced menu, plus added option to toggle full screen and to hibernate Kodi server
- changed 2 icons to be easy to recognize: "OSD" to display OSD when playing media, and "i" to display media info
- fixed nasty crash in original remote that appens when pressing play/pause while watching/listening online streaming content
